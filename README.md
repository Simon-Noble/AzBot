# AzBot
The AzBot Project

This is a simple Discord bot using the Hikari framework. It has basic funtionalities to track messages and respond accordingly. 

Most of its funtionality does nothing useful

One of it's few useful funtions is to play the RedSquareGreenSquare game through the Discord interface. 
It is a custom recreation of the game Tents and Trees for my personal use.
Additionally it can record data if a useable form for my Best Game Survey, within a different project


The main funtionality is through the bot.py file, which has all the funtions of the bot. 

AzBot.py is a custom child of the lightbulb.BotApp class, that allows for the RedSquare game to be played by multiple users

The RedSquare game is mostly self explanitory as it is the code for the game.
